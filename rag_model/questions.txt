CEM samples for movements of the base are constrained to a rectangular area in front of the waste station.1 (2) We employ a controller that executes commands only in a best-effort manner, meaning that trajectories are only executed to the point where any part of the robot (except the fingers) would collide with a voxel map representation of robot’s direct environment, reconstructed from the robots depth sensors. (3) All motion is interrupted when a force threshold of 7N is exceeded at the wrist.
